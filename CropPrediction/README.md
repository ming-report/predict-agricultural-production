# CropPrediction
Crop Production Forecaster
Inspiration
CropCast was inspired by the growing need for data-driven decision-making in agriculture. With climate change affecting crop yields and food security becoming an increasingly important global issue, we saw an opportunity to leverage machine learning to help farmers and policymakers make more informed decisions about crop production.
What it does
CropCast is an advanced crop production forecasting tool that:

Analyzes historical crop production data across different states and years.
Visualizes production trends for specific crops and states.
Uses LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks to predict future crop yields.
Provides detailed visualizations and metrics to assess forecast accuracy.
Offers an interactive interface for users to explore different crop and state combinations.

How we built it
We built CropCast using:

Python for data processing and machine learning.
Pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
TensorFlow and Keras for implementing the LSTM model.
Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.
Streamlit for creating an interactive web application.
Scikit-learn for data preprocessing and model evaluation metrics.

Challenges we ran into

Data preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the time series data for the LSTM model was complex.
Model tuning: Finding the right architecture and hyperparameters for the LSTM model to achieve accurate predictions was challenging.
Handling multiple features: Balancing the importance of different features in the prediction model required careful consideration.
User interface design: Creating an intuitive and responsive interface that could handle various user inputs and display complex data was tricky.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

Successfully implemented an LSTM model for time series forecasting.
